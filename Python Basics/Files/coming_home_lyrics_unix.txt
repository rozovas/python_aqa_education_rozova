I'm comin' home
Will it be my heart or will it be his?
But I just have one last question
I know that we're takin' chances, you told me life was a risk

'Cause I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home

But I understand your sadness so I guess I should just hold my tongue
I never thought you could leave me, I figured I was the one
But I'd rather wake up beside you and breathe that ol' familiar smell
I've seen a palace in London, I've seen a castle in Wales

'Cause I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home

I'll never take any pictures cause I know I'll just be right back
I've been through Nova Scotia, Sydney to Halifax
I've been to Lincoln, Nebraska and hell you know it ain't worth shit
I've never been to Alaska, but I can tell you this,

'Cause I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home

I've driven down the highway 1 just hopin' that I'd see you soon
I've been through the Rockies, I've seen Saskatoon
I've driven down the 90, hell I've seen America's best
I've seen the streets in the West
Well I've been down to Georgia
